/*Notes: 
- want my logo to always be on the left and mu about me, projects and contact me (aka the unordered list ul tag) to be on the right
- do this with justify content space between on nav bar  as the unordered list and div where the logo lives inside
-  all available space is placed between the first and last items, pushing both items to opposite edges of the container.
