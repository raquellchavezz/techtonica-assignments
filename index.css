/*Notes: 
- want my logo to always be on the left and mu about me, projects and contact me (aka the unordered list ul tag) to be on the right
- do this with justify content space between on nav bar  as the unordered list and div where the logo lives inside
-  all available space is placed between the first and last items, pushing both items to opposite edges of the container.

- use the inspect on chrome dev tools to check out the elements we have created so far. You can inspect the page & the elements 
- want spacing for h1 tag and description (software eng oin training) we can create div and put both inside to change the spacing all at once
