# Weather Forecast app

> This app is a fullstack app build using React Frontend and Express Backend with hardcode data. This project doesn't render real-time data

## Quick Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yosolita1978/HardCodeDataWeatherApi.git <nameyourfolder>
```

move inside the directory

```bash
cd <nameyourfolder>
```

next move into the server and install dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Open another terminal then cd into the client, install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```
### To start servers
Return to the terminal with the server folder and run the command `npm run dev`. This will run both servers with concurrently package

#### EADDRINUSE, Address already in use - Kill server
It's possible your server will already be running with a different project. [Here's a resource that explains how to find and kill the server blocking this process.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4075287/node-express-eaddrinuse-address-already-in-use-kill-server)

Note:
Server runs on http://localhost:8080 and client on http://localhost:3000
